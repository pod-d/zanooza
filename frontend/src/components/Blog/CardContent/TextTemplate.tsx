          AR Gaming simply provides an enhanced, more immersive, and interactive
          experience for mobile gaming enthusiasts creating world-changing games
          while you’re outside interacting with the environment and potentially
          other real people.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the technology advances and other complementary technologies such
          as 5G start to be rolled out, the experience becomes even better with
          the ability to have more dynamic scenes and incorporate more advanced
          mobile gaming such as with AR shooter games which can bring more
          excitement to the AR gaming world.

          If you have the choice between a flat two-dimensional gaming
          experience or an exciting, interactive 3D AR gaming experience, you’ll
          get more out of the AR game because it feels more natural, and you can
          interact with the game and the real world environment at the same
          time.
        </p>
        <p>
          You’re no longer just sitting staring at a screen but have the
          excitement of moving and finding game elements in the real world with
          the AR game using the natural world as part of the game through
          advanced AI technology.

          Shooter games are some of the most popular games for adults and are
          extremely popular games for kids. They give people an opportunity to
          live out fantasies, explore worlds, and compete with other players
          around the world. The biggest disadvantage of current shooter games is
          that you’re stuck in a chair watching your avatar run around in either
          a first-person or third-person perspective.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your gaming experience is limited to what is available on the screen
          with static scenes that you repeatedly see unless you pay for upgrades
          or new games. You’re also never physically moving, which is a big
          problem for kids that get heavily involved in games instead of sports.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you bring AR gaming and mobile gaming together, you get a fully
          world-changing experience with dynamic scenes because the game is
          using your physical environment in the game so that you’re only ever
          limited by where you decide to go and play the game physically.
        </p>

          AR provides games for kids that get them out and moving so they can
          incorporate physical exercise with the fun of shooter games that
          generally keeps them inside. Similar to real-world games like
          paintball or airsoft, but with no added cost because almost everyone
          of any age now has a mobile device that can be used for AR gaming
